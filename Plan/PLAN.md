# Plan For Project

For this project we have to create an applications that would help a bootcamper on their journey to become a junior developer.

## UX

### User Persona

    - Created user persona Grace a bootcamper with age range 25 - 34 age.  Grace uses social media platforms such as: Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Twitter.  Also she uses fitbit and would like to track down her physical well being.

    Grace would like to track her during School of Code Bootcamp:
        - Mental Wellbeing
        - Progress
        - Tasks to revisit

### Target Audience

Carried a discussion with fellow bootcamper with regards to an app that would track:

        - Mental Wellbeing
        - Progress
        - Ability to Tasks to revisit

- Nicholas Gomis
- Amrit Atwal
- Wayne
- Ifran Hussain
- Maxi Sinopoli
- Troy Webber
- Pyi
- Mohammed Mohamud
- Najma Elmi

Received positive feedback that this application would be useful during bootcamp to help bootcampers reflect on their progress and as well as to track.

Goal stretch to create a single signon for feature that coaches could access application and review group progress.
